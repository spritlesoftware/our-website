faq:
  question1: "What is the purpose of the Building Management System?"
  answer1: "A Building Management System is an emerging technology that has the potential to get inputs from all the IoT devices in your building and help you with building maintenance tasks. It involves monitoring all the areas of your building and figuring out where your attention is needed. From looking for faults to managing the tickets that get created by assigning them to the right technician, it brings in lots of ease in building management. "
  question2: "What are the main functions of a Building Management System?"
  answer2: "The main functions of a BMS include: <br>
     Monitoring the inspected areas of the building <br>
     Fault detection and alerting the maintenance team about them <br>
     Fault ticket generation and management <br>
     Automate time-consuming tasks of building management, etc."
  question3: "What is the ROI of implementing Smart Building Management Systems in buildings?"
  answer3: "They make building maintenance easy and relieve the maintenance team from working around the clock to track and resolve tickets manually."
